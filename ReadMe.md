These are some of the Machine learning classification algorithms I implemented.
Implementation is done from the derived theoretical mathematical model.
Results are then compared with industry standards/standard available libraries.

These may not give optimal results as few of the available libraries; the basic objective for this project is to implement the classification algorithms from ground up rather than using ready made models. For best possible results, compare the results of these with stand libraries and choose the best option.

Models implemented as of now:
- Bayes classification for randomly generated Gaussian distribution points
- Least Square classification with scrapper for Iris data (Scrapper to extract data from website)
